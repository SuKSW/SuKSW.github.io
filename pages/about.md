Hi, I am Subhashinie Koshalya. I am a graduate of University of Moratuwa, Faculty of Engineering, Department of Computer Science and Engineering. I find satisfaction in writing software especially when it involves distributed computing, security, data science or systems that heavily focus on modularity.

Outside software, I find inspiration from: 

- Things that are creative
    - Creations by architects, web designers, cartoonists, artists, storytellers
    - Technological innovations
    - Tech that existed centuries ago
- People who are resilient, joyful, wise and competent. 
    - too many to name.. 

This site is a continuation of the blog [here][wordpress_site]. I started it as a way to keep notes for myself and to share them with others who might find them useful. 

Everything I wrote was an extension to or a composition of things that I learnt from others (via stack overflow, documentations, blogs, in person); therefore the name of this site, "Extending the Inherited". Just like in OOP.
